title: About this Anthology
---
### Poetry as Memory  
Memories are fragile frozen balls of silly putty    
Thaw one out and it loses shape     
Thrown down they shatter into smaller shapes  

To compile this anthology to preserve my putty is a vain exercise
For me so much of my life is performitive and I am still learning what I am all about
In the interim I'm taking selfies of my synthetic strands
