title: About this Anthology
---
### Poetry as Memory
Memories are fragile frozen balls of silly putty    
Thaw one out and it loses shape     
Thrown down and they shatter into smaller shapes  

To compile this anthology to preserve my putty would be a vain exercise
For me so much of my life is performitive and I am still learning what I am all about
In the interim I'm taking pictures of the synthetic strands of my past lives
